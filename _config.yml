description: This machine learning regression project leverages census data for 20,640 districts in California comprising housing details, demographics, and median income to build a model that can accurately predict median housing values. The key steps involve importing the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, splitting into train and test sets, standardizing the features, applying regression algorithms like linear regression, decision tree, and random forest on the training data, evaluating performance using root mean squared error, and tuning the models. The end goal is developing the best performing model that minimizes prediction error and can generalize well to new housing data. This will enable accurate estimates of home values in California districts given a set of explanatory variables from new samples.
