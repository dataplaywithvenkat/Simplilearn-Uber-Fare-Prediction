description: This is a machine learning project that aims to design an algorithm to estimate taxi fares for passengers based on trip details. The goal is to build a fare calculator that provides accurate fare estimates to help passengers, especially tourists or those new to a city, understand the cost of their trips. The project involves analyzing a dataset of taxi trips with features like fare amount, pickup/drop locations, passenger count, etc. Key steps include data understanding, identifying the target variable (fare amount), feature selection, handling missing data, train/test split, applying regression models like linear regression and random forest regression, and comparing model accuracy. The project will leverage machine learning techniques to learn the relationships between trip details and fares in order to produce a robust fare estimation algorithm. Overall, this project enables the development of an AI-powered tool that can provide customized and accurate fare estimates to passengers to enhance their transportation experience in unfamiliar cities.
